# An Android-Based Fundamental Yoga Pose Training and Evaluation System Using MediaPipe Pose Estimation
This project aims to develop an Android-based system that assists users in practicing yoga poses correctly and conveniently. By leveraging **MediaPipe’s pose estimation framework**, the system detects human skeletal keypoints in real time and calculates **joint angles** to evaluate posture accuracy.
It provides **customizable training lists**, allowing users to practice multiple yoga poses in a single session. The integrated **voice feedback system** delivers real-time verbal instructions and corrections whenever an incorrect posture is detected, helping users adjust immediately.
After each training session, users can review detailed evaluation data through the app, including joint angle analysis, accuracy scores, and improvement suggestions. This enables users to effectively enhance their posture performance even without direct guidance from a yoga instructor.

The system consists of three main functional modules:  
  &bull; **Pose List:** Displays 10 fundamental yoga poses with descriptions, individual detection, and analysis features.  
  &bull; **Training List:** Provides preset or user-defined training routines, supporting batch pose training and detailed performance feedback.  
  &bull; **Settings:** Includes history record management, camera switching, user guide, and feedback submission functions.  

Developed with **Android Studio** and implemented with **multithreading and voice integration**, this system delivers an intelligent and interactive yoga training experience — combining real-time analysis, instant feedback, and comprehensive performance tracking.
